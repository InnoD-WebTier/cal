                This DeCal is intended for those students who are interested in studying for the first actuarial exam. The class is based mainly on problem solving with a little bit of lecture and will cover the exam’s main topics.<br/><br/>

                It is recommended that students be fairly familiar with concepts of Statistics 134. Some knowledge on multivariable calculus (Math 53) is an important pre-requisite.<br/><br/>

                Grade (P/NP) will be based on attendance, class participation, and performance on homework, which will be assigned every week. Students are required to have finished general lower division math (1A, 1B, 53) prior to enrollment of this course. Stat 134 is recommended, but not required.<br/><br/>

                This is sponsored by Professor David Brillinger.
